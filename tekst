/// SIMPLE CALCULATOR

this project I found on youtube and it was simple and fun

1.FIRST IN HTML WE CREEATE FORM WITH CLASS NAME, AND NAME, INSIDE OF FORM WE CREATE INPUT WITH
VALUE TYPE NAME READONLY, AND SPAN WITH CLASS OF NUM AND ON CLICK FUNCTION WITH 
document.calc.txt.value += '' 
(we add all the calculator digits and functions in multiple spans)
2.THEN STYLE EVERYTHING IN CSS 
(this is all in grid) 
3.THEN WE ADD EVAL FUNCTION INSIDE OF EQUAL
(eval(calc.txt.value)
4.AND ON CLEAR WE JUST ADD EMPTY VALUE "" CONTENT


this was very fast and simple buidling of calculator and I had to try it
